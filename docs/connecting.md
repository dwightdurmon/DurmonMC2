## Requirements

In order to connect to the Durmon Minecraft network, you will need to meet several requirements:

1. You must be whitelisted (see note below).
1. You must have a Java Minecraft account.
1. If you are planning to connect to the non-Forge servers, you need a regular Minecraft client (preferably running 1.15.2)
1. If you are planning to connect to the Forge server, you need a [Forge modded Minecraft client running 1.12.2](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.html) as well as the [required mods](https://durmon.org/downloads/mods.zip).



:::note

 __You must be whitelisted by the server owner!__ 
 
 You can contact the server owner (DoodleCat74/Gridcaster) in-person or on Discord at Elennight#2290.  Note that you probably will not be whitelisted if the server owner does not know you.
