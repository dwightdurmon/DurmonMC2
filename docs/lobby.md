## Overview

The server lobby is the starting point where you will arrive once you log on.  From the lobby, you can access all of the worlds connected to the server.

## Mystery Boxes

Periodically as you are playing, you will receive Mystery Boxes.  You can collect these from the Mystery Box NPC's and can open them from the Mystery Box Chests.  There are 4 areas (one in each corner of the lobby) where you can collect and open boxes.  The Mystery Boxes will give you cosmetic items you can use in the lobby and on some of the connected worlds.

## Jump Pads

Surrounding the spawn area and along the paths you will find jump pads which will help you move around.

## Nether Star Menu

On your actionbar, you will see a Nether Star which will open a menu with options.

## Cosmetics Menu

On your actionbar, you will see a White Shuker Box that you can use to access cosmetic items.
